#
# Q: WHAT IS TESTED HERE?
#
# A: 
#
# - Creates:
#   * OpenStackNetConfig
#   * OpenStackControlPlane
#   * OpenStackBaremetalSet
#   * OpenStackBackupRequest (in "save" mode)
# - Checks that the OpenStackBackupRequest starts in quiescing state
# - Once quiesced, checks that the OpenStackBackupRequest ends in the saved state
# - Checks for the existence of a corresponding OpenStackBackup with the proper resources within its spec
# - Creates an OpenStackBackupRequest (in "cleanRestore" mode) targeting the created OpenStackBackup for restoration
# - Checks that the "cleanRestore" cleans all OSP-D operator resources
# - Checks that the new OpenStackBackupRequest enters the "Loading" state
# - Checks that the new OpenStackBackupRequest reaches the "Restored" state
#
# NOTE: This test assumes you have two (and only two!) extra OCP workers allocated to your cluster as 
#       BaremetalHosts, that are not in-use as actual cluster nodes
#

#
# Attempt to "clear the field" if necessary
